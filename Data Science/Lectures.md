# 02 - Ethics
## Venn Diagram of Ethics
![[Pasted image 20220628153424.png]]

The Facebook Study (go through the slides for details...)
- No IRB
- No Consent (except Terms of Service)
- No debriefing
- Claims made that user were psychologically harmed

## The common Rule & Belmont Report
The Belmont Report is an ethical guidline.

## Informed Consent
Individuals know:
- how their data will be used
- any risks or benefits
- of any possible consequences
Individuals can:
- withdraw consent at any time
- have their data removed from the dataset

### The Belmont Report
The Belmont Report, published in 1970s by the
National Commission for the Protection of Human
Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, is a
statement of basic ethical principles and guidelines
that should assist in resolving the ethical problems
that surround the conduct of research with human
subjects.

The Belmont Report presents **three principles**; serve as
basic concepts in the conduct of research with human
subjects:
• Beneficence
• Respect for Persons
• Justice

---

### Beneficence and Risk/Benefit Analysis
*“Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by
respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm, but also by **making efforts to secure their well-being**.”*
“Beneficence...requires that we protect against risk of
harm to subjects and also that we be concerned about
the loss of the substantial benefits that might be
gained from research.”

### When isn't consent required
1. When minimal risk research can’t otherwise be conducted.
or
2. When an activity is designed to assure or improve quality rather than contribute to generalizable knowledge, in which case it doesn’t meet the Common Rule’s definition of “research,” (45 C.F.R. §46.102(d))

---

## The Facebook Study: Legality
**Why Isn’t Informed Consent Always Legally Or Ethically Required for Human Subjects Research?**
• Because research ethics is informed by more than the principle of
respect for persons’ autonomy.
• It’s also informed by beneficence and justice.
• Balancing these principles yields exceptions to informed consent

## Before sharing the result of a project
1. You’ve considered bias and ensured your conclusions are fair.
2. You’ve checked for mistakes.
3. Your work can not be used to harass people, especially minorities, in any way.
4. Your analysis is independent of your opinion about the specific problem you're trying to solve using data.
5. Can individuals be inadvertently identified through your project?

# 03 - Data Science Questions
**Data Science questions should...**
- **Be answerable with (available/attainable) data**
- Specify what's being measured
- Have relevancce to someone or something
- Be specific

## Example question
Bad:
	In Manhattan does Uber cause more traffic?
Improved:
	Is there a relationship between the amount of active Uber drivers and the average travel time in road segments in Manhattan?

Good questions:
- How many Model 3s will Tesla sell in San Diego during the third quarter?
- How many students will apply for admission to UCSD in 2019?

# 04 - Reproducibility
## Reproducibility
- “re-performing the same analysis (with the same code) using a different analyst”

**A study may fail to be reproduced because...**
- Data nolonger available
- Poor documentation
- Code missing
- Different methods, software versions, settings...


## Replicability
**Replicable Data Science**
- “re-performing the experiment and collecting new data”

Replicability is a lot harder than reproducibility

**How do we define Reproducibility**
- “The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials.”

Why would a study fail to **replicate?**
- Finding was not "real"
- Measurement error
- Variable finding
- Samples comes from different population
- Different experimental design or conditions
- Fraud :(

## Comformation Bias
A cognitive bias wherein humans have a tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.

---

# 05 - Programming

Data Scientists:
- excel at getting the data they need (SQL)
- explore & clean the data (R, Python)
- are very comfortable working with tabular data
- prioritize reproducibility
- program to accomplish a tast/answer a question

---

# 06 - Project Management

Git stuff...

# 07 - Data

- Gain familiarity with different data types i.e. variables
- Learn about structured, semi-structured, unstructured data
- What is a relational database and why joining data is key
- Explore example projects that use different data types

**Data:** anything that can be stored in a computer

All of this data is made up of
- Variables (statistical analysis)
- Features (machine learning)

## Data types

- Quantitative: What you can measure objectively
    - Integer, Discreate (1, 2, 3...)
    - Continuous (0.1, 0.12, 0.3...)
- Qualitative: What you can't easily measure
    - Nominal, Discrete (Red, Blue, Green...)
    - Ordinal (low, med, high)
    - Character ("hellow")
    - Binomial (T/F)

## Structured, Semi-Structured, Unstructured Data

- Semi-structured
    - spreadsheets (tbular data)
    - JSON, XML, CSV...
- Structured
    - relational databases (RDBMS) (use SQL to query)
- Unstructured
    - everything else (video, image, audio, texts)

### Relational Databases: a set of independent tables

1. Efficient Data Storage
2. Avoid Ambiguity
3. Increase Data Privacy
4. Based on Relational Algebra
