## The common Rule & Belmont Report
The Belmont Report is an ethical guidline. 

## Informed Consent

- of any possible consequences

### The Belmont Report
The Belmont Report, published in 1970s by the
National Commission for the Protection of Human
Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, is a
statement of basic ethical principles and guidelines
that should assist in resolving the ethical problems
that surround the conduct of research with human
subjects.

The Belmont Report presents **three principles**; serve as
basic concepts in the conduct of research with human
subjects:
• Beneficence
• Respect for Persons
• Justice

### Beneficence and Risk/Benefit Analysis
*“Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by
respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm, but also by **making efforts to secure their well-being**.”*
“Beneficence...requires that we protect against risk of
harm to subjects and also that we be concerned about
the loss of the substantial benefits that might be
gained from research.”

### When isn't consent required
1. When minimal risk research can’t otherwise be conducted.  
or
2. When an activity is designed to assure or improve quality rather than contribute to generalizable knowledge, in which case it doesn’t meet the Common Rule’s definition of “research,” (45 C.F.R. §46.102(d))

## The Facebook Study: Legality
**Why Isn’t Informed Consent Always Legally Or Ethically Required for Human Subjects Research?**
• Because research ethics is informed by more than the principle of
respect for persons’ autonomy.
• It’s also informed by beneficence and justice.
• Balancing these principles yields exceptions to informed consent

3. Your work can not be used to harass people, especially minorities, in any way.  
4. Your analysis is independent of your opinion about the specific problem you're trying to solve using data.  
5. Can individuals be inadvertently identified through your project?
